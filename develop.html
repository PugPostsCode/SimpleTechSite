				<!-- How to Develop for us -->
				<div id="htd">
					<h1>
						Want to Become a Developer?
					</h1>
					
					<p>
						We encourage the accessibility of the game development market; so, with the SɪmpleKɪd, anyone can be a developer!
						Game development has never been simpler with our wide selection of supported programming languages and extensive documentation (coming soon).
						And, for a limited time, <em>you</em> can send us <em>your</em> game and have a chance at it being published by SɪmpleTech!
						Contact us using our development email or phone number at the bottom of this page.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Our Design Philosophy -->
				<div id="dsph">
					<h2>
						Why Does it Look Like That?
					</h2>
					
					<p>
						The SɪmpleKɪd is all about simplicity, it's in the name! But it's also about function and delivering a fun gaming experience to <em>you</em>, the user.
						Simple, directional movement in 2D spaces has already been solved by the d-pad, so it's an obvious inclusion, but what about the three face buttons?
						Having three face buttons allows the console to use modern hardware whilst still providing a fresh and unique gaming experience.
						Three? That's one more than our competitors! The face buttons also provide a simple and intuitive design that anyone can use.
						Not to be forgotten, you can't have a good control set without a start button!
